## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Pseudoclasses
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media queries

### What I learned

In this project I learned a lot of positioning the patterns. I added more media-queries for the right responsiveness. 
And I learned it is easier to directly use media-queries on my approach of projects.

### Continued development

I would like to get more into JavaScript and extend my knowledge of HTML and SCSSr own plans for continued development.**
